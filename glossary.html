        <ul>
        <li>Linux: An open-source family of operating systems
        <ul>
        <li>Linux distro (distribution): One of the operating systems in
        the Linux family (i.e. using the Linux kernel)</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>OCI: Open Container Initiative; a project for open-source
        standardization of containers</li>
        <li>Containers: An isolated environment to run programs, great
        for avoiding conflicting dependencies and for ease-of-use</li>
        <li>Container image: The base filesystem of a container
        <ul>
        <li>OCI image: The OCI's standard for container images, used by
        essentially all Linux container platforms</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>AUR: Arch User Repository, a repository for Arch Linux
        packages which are maintained by users. AUR only hosts
        computer-readable instructions and related files (via
        <code>PKGBUILD</code> files) for creating the packages, not the
        packages or programs themselves</li>
        <li>Filesystem: The system which keeps track of how data is
        written to disk, like NTFS, FAT32, or ext4. Some filesystems,
        like ZFS or btrfs, have extra features like redundancy or
        compression.<img src="image.png" title="alt text" alt="alt text" /></li>
        <li>Git: The most common version control system by far - keeps
        track of different versions of files, can be used to resolve
        conflicting changes, etc.
        <ul>
        <li>Forking: Copying a Git repository and optionally and making
        changes to it. Can be simply to contribute the changes back to
        the upstream project later, or to use something as a base for
        your own project.</li>
        <li>Branches: Different "chains" of versions of code, which can,
        well, branch apart, merge back together, and so on. Different
        branches don't necessarily have to be related whatsoever, but
        they usually are made from other branches.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Repository: Usually refers to either a Git repository (i.e.
        a Git project), or a server hosting packages to be installed by
        a package manager.</li>
        <li>GUI toolkit: A set of programs used for making graphical
        interfaces
        <ul>
        <li>Qt: A GUI toolkit with an appearance similar to normal
        Windows interfaces; pronounced "cute"</li>
        <li>GTK: A more (literally) rounded GUI toolkit, hated by some
        for its programs usually having highly excessive whitespace and
        poor design (though there are some exceptions)</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Window manager: The program which keeps track of and
        determines where each program's window(s) go.</li>
        <li>Desktop Environment: A window manager, programs, and
        configurations, all wrapped up into a bundle, providing a
        comprehensive desktop.
        <ul>
        <li>GNOME: A popular GTK-based extensible desktop
        environment.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Virtual machine: A virtual computer.</li>
        <li>Partition: A part of a disk. For example, modern computers
        have a small boot partition and a big partition holding all the
        actual data.</li>
        <li>GParted: GNOME's partition manager - and my favorite
        partition manager.</li>
        <li><code>sudo</code>: Super user do; runs a command as
        <code>root</code>, Linux's admin account.</li>
        <li>Tarball: An archive of data, preserving its file and
        directory structure. Not compressed, though its tools come with
        options to compress it after generation.</li>
        <li><code>apt</code>: The package manager for Debian-based Linux
        distros.</li>
        <li>blendOS: "Arch Linux, made declarative, immutable and
        atomic."
        <ul>
        <li>Akshara: blendOS's system rebuilder/updater</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><code>pacman</code>: Arch Linux's package manager, also used
        by blendOS</li>
        <li><code>PKGBUILD</code>: A file defining how to build a
        package which can be install by <code>pacman</code>.</li>
        <li><code>iso</code> file: A disk image file, can be "burned" to
        a USB flash drive (or any other disk) and booted off of, often
        used for Linux installers and/or live images.</li>
        </ul>
