        comparing DwarFS</h1>
        <p>DwarFS is a filesystem developed by the user mhx on GitHub
        [1], which is self-described as "A fast high compression
        read-only file system for Linux, Windows, and macOS." One of my
        ideas for blendOS was to layer different packages, and combined
        with its compression and option to be mounted as a FUSE-based
        filesystem, it's an appealing option for this use case - blendOS
        is immutable, so it might as well have some compression.</p>
        <h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
        <p>The datasets being used for this test will be the
        following:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>25 GiB of null data (just <code>00000000</code> in
        binary)</li>
        <li>25 GiB of random data<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
        <li>Data for a 100 million-sided regular polygon; ~26.5 GiB<a
        href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
        <li>The current Linux longterm release source (<a
        href="https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v6.x/linux-6.6.58.tar.xz">6.6.58</a>
        [2]); ~1.5 GB</li>
        <li>For some rough latency testing:
        <ul>
        <li>1024 4 KiB files filled with null data (again, just
        <code>00000000</code> in binary)</li>
        <li>1024 4 KiB files filled with random data</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>All this data should cover both latency and read speed
        testing for data that compresses differently - extremely
        compressible files with null data, decently compressible files,
        and random data which can't be compressed well.</p>
        <h3 id="what-filesystems">What filesystems?</h3>
        <p>I'll be benchmarking DwarFS, fuse-archive (with tar files),
        and btrfs. In some early, basic testing, I found that mounting
        any <em>compressed</em> archives with <code>fuse-archive</code>,
        a tool for mounting archive file formats as read-only
        filesystems, took far too long. Additionally, being FUSE-based,
        these would have slightly worse performance than kernel
        filesystems, so I tried to use a FUSE driver as well for btrfs.
        Unforunately, I ran into a bug, so I won't be able to quite do
        an equivalent test; btrfs will only be running in the
        kernel.</p>
        <p>During said early testing, I also ran into the fact that most
        compressed archives, like Gzip-compressed tar archives, also
        took far too long to <em>create</em>, because Gzip is
        single-threaded. So all the options with no chance of being used
        have been marked off, and I'll only be looking into these
        three.</p>
        <p>DwarFS also took far too long to create on its default
        setting, but on compression level 1, it's much faster -
        11m2.738s for the ~80 GiB total, and considering</p>
        <h2 id="running-the-benchmark">Running the benchmark</h2>
        <p>First installed it by cloning the repository, installing it
        using Cargo, then added its completions to fish (just for this
        session):</p>
        <div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
        class="language-sh"><code class="language-bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> clone https://git.askiiart.net/askiiart/disk-read-benchmark</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="bu">cd</span> ./disk-read-benchmark</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">cargo</span> install <span class="at">--path</span> .</span>

        <p>Then I prepared all the data:</p>
        <div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre
        class="language-sh"><code class="language-bash"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">disk-read-benchmark</span> prep-dirs</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">disk-read-benchmark</span> grab-data</span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">./prepare.sh</span></span></code></pre></div>
        <p><code>disk-read-benchmark</code> prepares all the
        directories, generates the data to be used for testing, then
        <code>./prepare.sh</code> uses the data to generate the DwarFS
        and tar archives.</p>
        <p>To run it, I just ran this:</p>
        <div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre
        class="language-sh"><code class="language-bash"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">disk-read-benchmark</span> benchmark</span></code></pre></div>
        <p>Which outputs the data at
        <code>data/benchmark-data.csv</code> and
        <code>data/bulk.csv</code> for the single and bulk files,
        respectively.</p>
        <h2 id="results">Results</h2>

        <h3 id="random-read-latency">Random read latency</h3>
        <p>The FUSE-based filesystems run into a bit of trouble here -
        with incompressible data, DwarFS has a hard time keeping up for
        some reason, despite keeping up just fine with larger random
        reads on the same data, and so it takes 3 to 4 seconds to run
        random read latency testing on the 25 GiB random file.
        Meanwhile, when testing random read latency in
        <code>fuse-archive</code> pretty much just dies, becoming
        ridiculously slow (even compared to DwarFS), so I didn't test
        its random read latency at all and just had its results put as 0
        milliseconds.</p>
