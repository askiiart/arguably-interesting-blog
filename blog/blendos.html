        <h1 id="checking-out-blendos">Checking out blendOS</h1>
        <p>blendOS is self-described as "Arch Linux, made declarative,
        immutable and atomic." And yeah, that's a pretty good
        description of what it is. But you can never <em>really</em>
        tell what a distro is like without trying it, so...</p>
        <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
        <p>I decided to just run blendOS in a virtual machine; I had a
        bunch of data I hadn't backed up yet and was actively working
        on, and didn't feeling like switching yet given I had no
        experience with blendOS v4[^1] - I've actually tried blendOS v3
        before, back when v4 was in alpha, but it had practically zero
        documentation, not even <code>man</code> pages, so I gave up on
        it very quickly. But with v4, hopefully it's improved since
        then.</p>
        <h2 id="first-use">First use</h2>
        <p>Upon first boot, blendOS drops you into a pretty standard
        GNOME session, on account of the <code>/system.yaml</code> file
        by default:</p>
        <div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
        class="language-yaml"><code class="language-yaml"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">impl</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> http://github.com/blend-os/tracks/raw/main</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">repo</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> https://pkg-repo.blendos.co</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">track</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> default-gnome</span></span></code></pre></div>
        <p>At first I wasn't sure what impl is doing, but it seems to be
        combined with the track to get the URL for the raw
        <code>yaml</code> file[^1].</p>
        <p>This is actually a really interesting bit <em>which isn't
        documented</em>, as it means you can just, say, host your own
        track(s) for all your computers in a Git repo, and they can each
        inherit from other configs[^2] or be overridden locally; this
        actually seems like a very interesting and viable way to
        centrally manage many computers running Linux, and given I'm
        constantly switching between several computers; I can just put
        my config(s) in one repo, and pull from that.</p>
        <h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
        <p>It's quite basic, but blendOS actually works very well for
        me; I already have a Git repo of <a
        href="https://git.askiiart.net/askiiart/configs">all my
        configs</a>, which are intended to be run from a clean
        installation automatically, so for blendOS I just have to put
        those scripts into the yaml file and adapt it so the packages
        are listed in the YAML rather than being installed with
        <code>pacman</code> or <code>yay</code>.</p>
        <h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>
        <p>Biggest of all blendOS's problems is how slow it is to
        rebuild. It doesn't save "layers" of packages like <a
        href="https://github.com/coreos/rpm-ostree"><code>rpm-ostree</code></a>
        (as used by Fedora atomic)</p>
        <h2 id="wishlist">Wishlist</h2>

        <h2 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>[^1] That is,
        <code>http://github.com/blend-os/tracks/raw/main</code> +
        <code>/</code> + <code>default-gnome</code> +
        <code>.yaml</code></li>
        <li>[^2] In the provided <code>blend-os/tracks</code> repo,
        <code>default-gnome</code> actually inherits from the
        <code>gnome</code> track.</li>
