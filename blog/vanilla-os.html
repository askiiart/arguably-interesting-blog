        "Filesystem": Vanilla OS</h1>
        <p>In looking for a layered solution to blendOS's issues, I
        found that the lead maintainer and creator of blendOS was
        looking into using OCI images, and has even forked a repo from
        Vanilla OS. So I'm trying out Vanilla OS's usage of OCI images
        (which are inherently layered) to see about implementing a
        similar system in blendOS.</p>
        <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
        <p>Installation is pretty simple, you're again dropped into a
        simple GNOME session with a GTK installer:</p>
        <img src="/assets/vanilla-os/1.png"
        title="A basic GNOME session with a white GTK-based installer; it&#39;s showing the date and time/time zone selector." alt="A basic GNOME session with a white GTK-based installer; it&#39;s showing the date and time/time zone selector." />
        <p>The process was very similar to blendOS's, though it also
        detects virtual machines and offers an option to install tools
        (e.g. clipboard sharing, video drivers) to help with that.</p>
        <p>Another notable bit is that it requires more space than
        blendOS, with a minimum disk size of 50 GB, but given its A/B
        slot architecture (which I'll get to later), this makes
        sense.</p>
        <h2 id="first-boot">First boot</h2>
        <p>On first boot, there's a very similar setup tool, surely
        based off the installer. It makes you put in your language,
        timezone, etc. again, which I was a bit annoyed by, but it's no
        big deal. Then it has you create your login, select what you
        want installed (from basic programs like a calendar, office
        suite, etc.), then restarts and does all that.</p>
        <img src="/assets/vanilla-os/2.png"
        title="A similar wizard to the installer; it has the Vanilla OS logo and says &quot;Welcome&quot;, &quot;Make your choices, this wizard will take care of everything&quot;" alt="A similar wizard to the installer; it has the Vanilla OS logo and says &quot;Welcome&quot;, &quot;Make your choices, this wizard will take care of everything&quot;" />
        <p>Then you just get a little slideshow detailing automatic
        updates, its Apx package manager, and other basics, nothing
        interesting, and nothing I care about.</p>
        <h2 id="usage-and-configuration">Usage and configuration</h2>
        <p>I tried checking the docs (<em>Vanilla OS Docs</em>), which
        by themselves were difficult to find. They're a bit hidden in
        "Help" despite being <em>absolutely essential</em> to using this
        distro[^1]. But what I found easily was screenshots of
        Overwatch. (<em>Vanilla OS</em>)</p>
        <p>Regardless, once I found the docs, I tried to figure out how
        it worked, and I was still very confused. After looking over it
        again, I decided to check Apx's docs, its package manager, and
        found how to install packages, of course. (<em>Vanilla OS
        Docs</em>) I tried to install GParted; after it not running at
        first due to Vanilla OS not being configured correctly and not
        showing a password prompt for it, causing GParted to exit, I ran
        it in the terminal with <code>sudo</code>, just to get a
        permission denied error. That's because all packages are
        installed in containers, there is no system package manager...
        kinda.</p>
        <h3 id="abroot">ABRoot</h3>
        <p>ABRoot is the magic behind Vanilla OS's OCI image backend. As
        far as I can tell (again, I don't believe there are no relevant
        for docs for this) it essentially generates a tarball of the
        relevant data for the new iteration, then symlinks to either
        that or the current iteration on boot, depending on what the
        user selects. It provides essentially no advantages over
        blendOS's approach, and is, in my opinion, massively
        overcomplicated. (<em>GitHub: Vanilla-os/abroot</em>)</p>
        <p>It also acts as a package manager of sorts - it's the only
        way to install packages system-wide on Vanilla OS, and it does
        this by running <code>apt</code> when the new image is built,
        similar to Akshara.</p>
        <p>ABRoot's config file is at
        <code>/etc/abroot/abroot.json</code>, but it doesn't support
        declarative system-wide packages. Instead, run the
        following:</p>
        <div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
        class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">abroot</span> pkg add <span class="va">$PACKAGE_NAME</span></span></code></pre></div>
        <p>(<em>Install additional drivers and libraries in Vanilla
        OS</em>)</p>
        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Vanilla OS wasn't very helpful as to OCI-based layers, but I
        don't think it was a complete waste of time. Vanilla OS gave me
        some ideas, and I like its backend's ideas; it will most likely
        serve as inspiration for when I add layers to blendOS. Plus, my
        idea would have an advantage: compression.</p>
        <p>But I'll get into it later, once it's a bit more fleshed out;
        plus, that's not the point of this post anyways.</p>
        <p>P.S. I can't get it across while keeping this post decent
        quality and on-topic, but I need to emphasize how confusing the
        docs were for Vanilla OS. It feels like they try to appeal to
        users with basic tech literacy while not explaining how it
        actually works or what anything does. They write how-to guides,
        not documentation.</p>
        <h2 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h2>
        <p>[^1] Below the big download button, there's a link to the
        installation guide, but this provides nothing helpful, it just
        guides you through the already extremely simple
        installation.</p>
